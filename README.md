# Email Crawler

A Python-based tool for searching specific terms on Google and scraping email addresses from the resulting web pages. 
The crawler is designed to assist in gathering email contacts related to various industries or keywords, enhancing outreach and marketing efforts.

## Features

- **Dynamic Search**: Users can input search terms directly in the terminal, making the process flexible and user-friendly.
- **Continuous Operation**: The script runs in a loop, allowing for multiple searches until the user decides to exit.
- **Duplicate Avoidance**: The script prevents the duplication of email addresses by checking against the existing list before appending.
- **Graceful Termination**: Users can exit the program at any time by typing 'exit' or using the `Ctrl + C` keyboard interrupt.

## Installation

To set up the email crawler, you'll need to have Python installed on your system. This script was built using Python 3.8 but should be compatible with Python 3.x versions.

1. Clone the repository or download the script to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries using pip (most of it should be preinstalled on Python 3.8
3. Run ```python crawl.py```
4. Enter any keyword to start gathering emails.
